I have created character app which is fetching data from the server using retrofit and showing in the recyclerview
then sending data to detail screen and there I have used Rooom database, you can add favorites by just
clicking on the floating action button or you can remove by just clicking on the remove button from from the database.

Using:

Kotlin
MVVM architectural pattern
LiveData
RecyclerView
Retrofit
Coroutine
ROOM
